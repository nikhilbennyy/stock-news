This program is helpful for people who are into stocks. 
In this program I'm using 'Tesla' as the company I'm intrested in.. 
With the help of API data, it checks if there is a 5% increase or decrease in price of the stocks between the opening and closing time.
If so, it sends a text message to your phone number saying that there's been a 5% price change in the companyy that you're intrested in,
and send recent news articles related to the company to give you insight into what caused the price change
